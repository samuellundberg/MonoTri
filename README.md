# MonoTri
Monochromatic Triangles problem for AZsPCs, summer 2021. http://azspcs.com/Contest/Cliques

With the algorithms penta (n > 20) and perfect16 (n < 20) I found the optimal graph colorings for all n in the competition.

All code for obtaining (5 algorithms and a solution validator) and storing graph colorings are located in main.py

create_entry.py takes results for given values of n and formates them to an competition entry and saves it in a text file.
