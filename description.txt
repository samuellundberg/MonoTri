The task
Given a value for n, use 3 colors to label the arcs of Kn (that is, the complete graph with n nodes) so as to
minimize the number of monochromatic triangles formed.

(Definitions: A complete graph is a graph in which every pair of nodes is connected by an arc. A monochromatic
triangle is a triangle whose three sides are the same color.)

For example, here is a coloring of K7. It contains 35 triangles, of which 3 are monochromatic (ADE, BCE and CDF).
Note that this coloring does not minimize the number of monochromatic triangles â€“ it is possible to paint the arcs of
K7 with 3 colors so that there are fewer than 3 monochromatic triangles.

The Contest
For each of the 25 values of n in
{17, 23, 27, 35, 39, 47, 59, 63, 75, 83, 87, 95, 107, 123, 135, 143, 147, 159, 167, 179, 183, 195, 203, 207, 215},
submit the coloring of Kn that best minimizes the number of monochromatic triangles in the graph.

For each value of n you can submit more than one coloring, but only your best coloring will count.

...

Your submission would therefore look like this:
